How to run my code.



1) Copy the python code in jupyter notebook or use .ipnyb extension file on to google collab Pro(I used google collab because my system was crashing or was taking too long to execute).
2) Else if you use python use pip and install nltk library, pandas, scikitlearn, and numpy.
3) Convert the .dat file to .csv file and save train csv file as 1643662645_8986752_1567602457_1187546_train_file.csv for train data set.
4) Convert the .dat file to .csv file and save test csv file as 1643662645_9617953_1567602457_126649_test.csv for test data set.
5) Run the code via run button in jupyter notebook and google collab for each cell or python and file_name in python.
6) First cell does the preprocessing of train set and applies lemmatization and does removal of punctuations, numbers, and stop words.
7) Second cell does the preprocessing of test set and applies lemmatization and does removal of punctuations, and stop words.
8) Next we do vectorization.
9) Then we applied Logistic regression.
9) We then write output to a text file, which can be found in file section of google collab.

NOTE:

If you want to run my code in Python instead of Google Collab, you'll need the following.
# Install pip and install following library pandas, nltk, sklearn, re
