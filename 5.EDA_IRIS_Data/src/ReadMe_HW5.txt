How to run my code.



1) Use .ipnyb extension file on to google collab Pro(I used google collab because my system was crashing or was taking too long to execute).
2) Upload in file section 1649181792_01407_1604554690_4994035_1601384279_9602122_iris_new_data.txt file for iris data set.
3) Upload in file section 1649182019_5350096_1604556007_243332_1601384482_8387134_image_new_test.txt file for image data set.
4) Run the code in google collab for each cell.
5) We then write output to a text file, which can be found in file section of google collab.
